## ðŸ§®  Mathematical Engineer (Data Science/AI/Optimization/Cybersecurity)

I'm a data scientist and Mathematics Engineer building projects that inspire me of the data world. Every solution I develop starts from the ground up from modeling and design to solving real-world problems with mathematics, code, and strategy. Whether it's uncovering patterns in datay, optimizing supply chains, or developing secure software, I always try to approach each challenge with precision and creativity.

> Extremely Passionate about uncovering intelligence through mathematics. My favorite area of exploration is AI, machine learning, and deep learning by transforming abstract theory into real-world computational solutions.

## ðŸ“‚ Projects

Here are some of the projects I've developed, combining data science, optimization, AI, and cryptography-cybersecurity. Basically, applied mathematics:

### [Secure Digital Signature System]()
Built a cryptographic digital signature platform using Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC), Python APIs, and Power Automate for secure document workflows.
