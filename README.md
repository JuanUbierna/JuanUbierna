## ðŸ§®  Mathematical Engineer (Data Science/AI/Optimization/Cybersecurity)

I'm a data scientist and Mathematics Engineer building projects that inspire me of the data world. Every solution I develop starts from the ground up from modeling and design to solving real-world problems with mathematics, code, and strategy. Whether it's uncovering patterns in datay, optimizing supply chains, or developing secure software, I always try to approach each challenge with precision and creativity.
